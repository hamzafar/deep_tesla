# DeepTesla: End-to-End Learning from Human and Autopilot Driving
This project was inspired by human driving, so they provided driving video taken from Tesla. The task was simple to predict the angle of steering based on the video steering.
The data is labled by actual steering angel also. The project can be found at [Deep Tesla](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deepteslajs/).

------------

The simple Convolutional Network of five layers is trained about 9 hours and it achieved **0.94 error**. If the model is trained further time this error can reduced to **~zero**. You can find the [architecture of network](https://github.com/hamzafar/deep_tesla/blob/master/CNN4car_0.94.js).
